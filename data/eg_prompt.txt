Big ideas, brought to life.
Back in 1995, Swedish investment company Kinnevik had a vision of founding a global customer service provider with big ambitions and brilliant clients. That's how Transcom was born. Within a decade, we expanded across Europe and soon after, kicked off work-at-home operations in North America, followed by business in the US, Canada and the Philippines. What made it possible? For one, a nimble attitude towards on, off, and nearshoring, which we call smartshoring. For another, endless curiosity, embracing cultures, and relentless commitment to our clients' success.
